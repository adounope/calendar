this program print the calendar of a chosen month in a chosen year,
the challenge is to not using any library besides iostream

enter year(1800 to 9999), month(1 to 12),
and some user preference to view a calendar (start week on whether sunday or monday, view it horizontally or vertically)
then the program will print the calendar of that month in that year

when entering month, besides entering value from 1 to 12, user can also input -1 to view the calendar of whole year
and inputting -3 to view 3 neighbouring month(the program will then ask user to input month to put at center)
